# ruby-challenge

Implement the methods names_list, names_list_alphabetical, random_name and random_team_split.

Do them in order and after completing each one grab a developer to talk through the solution (If you get stuck grab a developer too!).  Write RSpec tests for each method verifying they work as expected.

You'll need to have RSpec installed.

In the terminal in the root of the challenge directory run `rspec` to get tests running.  You can also run `ruby run.rb` to run the actual file (output the result of the method to the terminal if you do this - see the commented out "puts" part ar the end of run.rb)
